## Host file to block trackers and advertisements
          
A list of adserving and tracking sites maintained by me. This list will be updated frequently.   
You can request additional domains or report exsisting domains via <a href="https://github.com/anudeepND/blacklist/issues">Issues</a> tab.

| adservers.txt | 42,596      | A reliable host file containing advertising domains, trackers, malwares and other unsafe domains. I collect these domains from my Pi-Hole and I test them for a few days before adding to the list. You can request additional domains or report existing domains via [issues](https://github.com/anudeepND/blacklist/issues) tab.                  | Frequently       | [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anudeepND/blacklist/master/adservers.txt) |
| facebook.txt  | 4,000        | Host file containing domains related to facebook.com. This file doesn't block other Facebook products such as WhatsApp, Instagram etc. If you want to block all Facebook related services, use this [list](https://www.github.developerdan.com/hosts/lists/facebook-extended.txt) created by [lightswitch05](https://github.com/lightswitch05/hosts). | Occasionally     | [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anudeepND/blacklist/master/facebook.txt)   |
| coinminer.txt | 5,940        | This host file was created when JavaScript miners were added to torrent sites. Most of the domain in this file are still active today. I recommend you to use [CoinBlockerLists](https://gitlab.com/ZeroDot1/CoinBlockerLists) by ZeroDot1 along with this list.                                                                                      | Discontinued     | [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anudeepND/blacklist/master/CoinMiner.txt) |

### What is a host file?                 
       
 A hosts file, named hosts, is a plain-text file used by all operating systems to map hostnames to IP addresses. Host file preferred over DNS so  if a domain name is resolved by the hosts file, the request never leaves your computer.
       
***
           
### Location of your hosts file               
       
***Mac OS X, Android, Linux:*** `/etc/hosts`          
***Winodws 7, 8.0, 8.1, 10:*** `C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\hosts`         
***Windows 2000:*** `C:\WINNT\system32\drivers\etc\hosts`
       
 ***
       
### Usage

***Android:*** For non-rooted devices, this host can be used with [DNS66](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.jak_linux.dns66/), a free and open-source ad-blocker.

### How do I determine an ad domain?     
   
***DNSthingy Assistant***      
        
<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dnsthingy-assistant/fdmpekabnlekabjlimjkfmdjajnddgpc">This browser extension</a> will list all of the domains that are queried when a web page is loaded. You can often look at the list of domains and cherry pick the ones that appear to be ad-serving domains.
